Technical Solution that enables Small and Medium buisnesses and also track their progress

## My Work

There are 4 Modules that I will be making, All of these are targetted at increasing efficiency and speed of the Startups.
### None of these modules include any expensive service. Thus will be fairly adoptable by small scale industries
---
These are the modules I plan to complete:

1)Uptime Monitoring: One of the most important things that startups are afraid of, is their Websites going down due to various possible reasons
Using this service they can monitor any URL they wish. They will be notified via Text Messages about the status of the site.
No external paid service will be used, only external API used will be Twilio for sending messages.

2)Real time group video calling(Using AGORA RTC SDK)

3)ChatRooms: Join a room and chat with all other members of the group in Real time

4)Employee Management: Track the progress made by employees using various plots, Idea/Complaint Jotting Portal. People can post any New Idea, for everyone to see, And Seniors will be able to 
comment and upvote the idea.
